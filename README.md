### Lighthouse Labs Week 3 Day 1 Assignment - 2 Player Math game

##### The purpose of this assignment is to create a mini 2 player game using basic JavaScript.
##### Second iteration of it is built using Ruby.

Bascially, this is a 2 player game where players are alternatively prompted with simple math problems. Math questions are automatically generated by the game. The two numbers are picked randomly between 1 and 20. Both players start with 3 lives, and they each lose a life when they answer a question incorrectly. The game will end until one of the player loses all their lives.
